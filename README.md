## Requirements
There were five key requirements that formed the basis of this project:
- Create a function that can take a users input and store the new book object into an array
- Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page
- Add a new book button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for new book
- Add a button each book's display to remove the book from the library
- Add a button on each book's display to change it's 'read' status

## Outcome


Project forms part of the JavaScript curriculum provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
